# Basic Usage

## Copy files

::: tip Note

If you want to automate the process, use a [publisher](https://github.com/Laravel-Lang/publisher).
:::

After adding the dependency using composer (as described above) to your application you can find the language files under the directory `vendor/your/namespace`.

Copy the folders of languages that you want, in `resources/lang` or `lang` directory of your Laravel application.
